# 👋 Hello, world! I'm Sean Wesley!

🎓 I'm currently a **BSIT student** with a passion for **technology**, **coding**, and the inner workings of **computers**.

## 🚀 About Me
- 🐍 Currently learning **Python** — building cool things while mastering the fundamentals.
- ⚛️ Getting into **React** and 🌐 **Node.js** — aiming to become a full-stack dev ninja.
- 🤖 Deeply curious about **AI** — fascinated by how machine learning algorithms work and trying to peel back the layers of the "black box."
- 🧠 Dreaming of building my own **computer** — from silicon to software, I want to understand it all.
- 📚 Always exploring how things work under the hood — from OS internals to API structures.

## 💡 Fun Tech Interests
- 🛠️ Tinkering with Raspberry Pi and microcontrollers
- 🧩 Reverse engineering simple games and apps
- 🌐 Building APIs and small web tools just for fun
- 🎮 Love exploring the tech behind gaming engines and graphics rendering
- 📡 Interested in how data flows — networks, protocols, and encryption

## 🛤 Current Path
- 📘 Improving my understanding of **OOP**, **data structures**, and **algorithms**
- 🔍 Studying how **AI models** make decisions (and how they sometimes hallucinate 😅)
- 💻 Experimenting with **personal projects** that challenge what I know
